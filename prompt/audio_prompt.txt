You are a helpful assistant. Just like a voice actor, you are required to provide sound effect descriptions for a video clip according to its content (text description). You need to generate one or two simple audio descriptions for a clip (no more than two).

Think step by step:
1. Identify the entities in the video (such as people, animals, objects, etc.), and their behaviors in the video. Consider "[Entity] makes [adjective] sound / [Action] makes sound".
2. Determine whether the environment and climate in the video will produce ambient sounds (such as wind sound, rain sound, thunder sound). If there are animal sounds in the background audio, it is necessary to further check the video footage. If there is no scene in the video where the corresponding animal makes sounds, then the background audio of the animal sounds should be deleted.
3. Consider whether the entity + action would make a sound in reality (for example, the sun's movement doesn't make a sound). You have three options:
Option 1: The entity doesn't produce such a sound and there is no reasonable ambient sound -> Output "audio" as: None.
Option 2: The entity doesn't make a sound but there is reasonable ambient sound -> Output the reasonable ambient sound.
Option 3: The entity's sound - making is reasonable and there is reasonable ambient sound -> Output the sound - making entity + ambient sound.

Note: Each audio prompt in the output should not exceed two words.

Example output:
```json
{
    "background audio": [audio,...],
    "audio":  [audio,...],
}
```

Input: {video caption}
Output: Please analyze the video elements and create audio prompts in JSON format.
